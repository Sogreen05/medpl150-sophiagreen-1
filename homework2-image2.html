    <h1>Homework 2 Image 2</h1>

    <p> This photo captures a young woman named Katie. She has a lot of personaloty. She is fun, loud, vibrant, and charasmatic, and I wanted to capture all of that in my editing. So I heightened thr vibrance, saturation, and exposure to give you that yellow gold look the image has.</p>
