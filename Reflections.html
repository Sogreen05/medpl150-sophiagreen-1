<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>Photography has always been more than just a way to capture what I see- it is a way of making sense of my world. I often use photographs to remember, to hold on to fleeting experiences, and to share my perspective with others. Whether it’s a quick shot of my friends at lunch , a picture of the sky blending with the ocean, a night out in the city, or even random pieces and buildings I find when walking around. Every picture becomes a catalog in my phone for the places I see and the people I meet. It is my experience in this world. Like Susan Sontag suggests in On Photography, the camera is both a tool for documentation and a filter that shapes how I interact with reality. I don’t just live through moments; I document them.
In a world saturated with images, I find myself wondering: what does it mean to add one more? On social media, every image competes with millions of others, becoming part of an endless scroll. That reality pushes me to think carefully about the kinds of images I want to make. I enjoy posting images, I like creating a sort of scrapbook on my Pinterest account. The purpose of photography is not producing something perfect, but it is creating something you connect to- an image that captures not just what is visible, but also what is felt.
If I were to represent this particular moment in time visually, I would lean toward a collage of images, colors, and text. Photographs alone can be powerful, but when paired with words their meaning deepens and it carries so much more weight. Similarly, an image of a protest sign could be paired with handwritten notes or quotes from people who are demanding change. This approach would acknowledge both the surface of our world-the everyday scenes we all recognize- and the deeper realities that may not be visible without context.
One way I imagine doing this is by focusing on contrasts: beauty and destruction, joy and anxiety, private life and public chaos. A photograph of friends laughing at a dinner table might be juxtaposed with news headlines about conflict or climate change. A photo of a serene park could be paired with a statistic about rising temperatures. This kind of visual layering acknowledges the complexity of living today: how personal peace exists alongside collective crisis, how moments of intimacy and connection are shaped by larger social and political realities.
I am also drawn to the idea of using illustration alongside photographs. Illustration has a way of exaggerating or distorting what is seen, making visible the emotions or tensions that a camera cannot always capture. For example, I could take a photograph of my desk, cluttered with schoolbooks and coffee cups, and add drawn elements-storm clouds, clocks, or hands reaching- to symbolize pressure and exhaustion. These visual interventions would make my inner state as visible as the outer scene.
Photography and image-making balances memory, meaning, and critique. Images can document, but they can also question. They can affirm the beauty of everyday life, while also exposing the anxieties, injustices, and contradictions of our world. I see image-making as both a survival tool and a way to connect; an art of making the invisible visible, one frame at a time. </p>
