<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>Photography has always been more than just a way to capture what I see- it is a way of making sense of my world. I often use photographs to remember, to hold on to fleeting experiences, and to share my perspective with others. Whether it’s a quick shot of my friends at lunch , a picture of the sky blending with the ocean, a night out in the city, or even random pieces and buildings I find when walking around. Every picture becomes a catalog in my phone for the places I see and the people I meet. It is my experience in this world. Like Susan Sontag suggests in On Photography, the camera is both a tool for documentation and a filter that shapes how I interact with reality. I don’t just live through moments; I document them.
In a world saturated with images, I find myself wondering: what does it mean to add one more? On social media, every image competes with millions of others, becoming part of an endless scroll. That reality pushes me to think carefully about the kinds of images I want to make. I enjoy posting images, I like creating a sort of scrapbook on my Pinterest account. The purpose of photography is not producing something perfect, but it is creating something you connect to- an image that captures not just what is visible, but also what is felt.
If I were to represent this particular moment in time visually, I would lean toward a collage of images, colors, and text. Photographs alone can be powerful, but when paired with words their meaning deepens and it carries so much more weight. Similarly, an image of a protest sign could be paired with handwritten notes or quotes from people who are demanding change. This approach would acknowledge both the surface of our world-the everyday scenes we all recognize- and the deeper realities that may not be visible without context.
One way I imagine doing this is by focusing on contrasts: beauty and destruction, joy and anxiety, private life and public chaos. A photograph of friends laughing at a dinner table might be juxtaposed with news headlines about conflict or climate change. A photo of a serene park could be paired with a statistic about rising temperatures. This kind of visual layering acknowledges the complexity of living today: how personal peace exists alongside collective crisis, how moments of intimacy and connection are shaped by larger social and political realities.
I am also drawn to the idea of using illustration alongside photographs. Illustration has a way of exaggerating or distorting what is seen, making visible the emotions or tensions that a camera cannot always capture. For example, I could take a photograph of my desk, cluttered with schoolbooks and coffee cups, and add drawn elements-storm clouds, clocks, or hands reaching- to symbolize pressure and exhaustion. These visual interventions would make my inner state as visible as the outer scene.
Photography and image-making balances memory, meaning, and critique. Images can document, but they can also question. They can affirm the beauty of everyday life, while also exposing the anxieties, injustices, and contradictions of our world. I see image-making as both a survival tool and a way to connect; an art of making the invisible visible, one frame at a time.</p>


<p> Reading Nesrine Malik’s article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster” made me think about how artificial intelligence has not only blurred our sense of truth but also reshaped how we see art, politics, and each other. Malik describes “AI slop” as the constant flood of cheap, mass-produced images and videos that dominate our social media feeds - visuals that look real but are entirely generated by algorithms. It’s unsettling to realize how these fake yet familiar images have become part of our daily consumption. We live in a world where a convincing political photo, a protest scene, or even a piece of digital art can circulate thousands of times before anyone questions whether it’s real. The more we scroll, the less we seem to notice that the line between truth and fabrication has disappeared.
Politics, once rooted in human conversation and debate, has become one of the biggest casualties of this shift. Malik’s argument about “AI slop” mirrors what we see in modern political discourse: a replacement of reality with spectacle. In the past, political disagreement could at least exist within a shared understanding of facts. Now, deepfakes and AI-generated propaganda have made it almost impossible to tell what’s genuine. Political attacks are built on digital illusions; images of politicians in false scenarios, manipulated quotes, or AI-generated events that never happened. What could have been spaces for healthy debate have turned into battlegrounds of misinformation, where emotional reactions matter more than evidence. The internet rewards outrage and speed, not accuracy, and AI only accelerates that. As Malik warns, this creates a kind of moral fatigue, where people eventually stop caring whether something is real. It’s frightening to think that the very tools meant to connect us are now dividing us through manufactured confusion.
This erosion of truth doesn’t just damage politics - it changes how we experience art and imagery altogether. Art once served as a bridge between reality and imagination, a way to see the world through someone else’s eyes. But in a culture dominated by AI-generated images, art risks losing that human touch. When anyone can type a few words into a prompt and produce something “beautiful,” it raises the question: what is beauty worth if no one felt anything while creating it? I think Malik’s warning about AI distorting reality extends to how we now view creativity itself. We are becoming used to perfection without process, visuals without stories, and art without artists. The emotional honesty that once defined human creation is being replaced by polished emptiness.
The danger of “AI slop” isn’t only that it deceives us - it’s that it numbs us. When everything we see could be fake, we stop looking for meaning. Both art and politics depend on trust: trust in what we see, and in who is behind it. If we lose that, we don’t just lose the truth: we lose the ability to care about it.</p>
<p> In “Motherhood in Crisis: Sierra Leone – A Mother’s Battle,” illustration is used to tell Aminata’s story in a way that feels both intimate and bearable. The drawn scenes allow viewers to witness experiences that would be too painful, private, or impossible to capture with a camera- moments of childbirth, miscarriage, and the death of her children. The illustrations create a sense of distance from the trauma, softening the edges of grief while still conveying the weight of her loss. Visually, they contrast with the sharp realism of the photographs at the end, which reintroduce the audience to the true reality of her experiences. The animation can make the story feel almost fictional at first, like something out of a graphic novel or storybook, but the photographs remind viewers that these are not imagined tragedies- they are real and ongoing for countless women. Watching Aminata’s story unfold made me think deeply about my own mother’s miscarriage. Though my family’s experience held far less fear and loss, I recognized the quiet heartbreak, the lingering ache that exists even when the world moves on. The story allowed me to connect, however slightly, to the emotional reality of pregnancy loss and the vulnerability that comes with trusting healthcare systems that may not always protect or support women. One moment that struck me most was when the doctor spoke only to Aminata’s husband, dismissing her voice. She is the one enduring the pain and physical trauma, yet her perspective and suffering were silenced. That moment reminded me of how often women’s pain is filtered through others, ignored, or minimized, even when their bodies carry the weight of the experience. The illustrations themselves are expressive in ways photography cannot replicate. The soft, muted colors and delicate line work evoke a sense of intimacy and allow viewers to linger on moments that would be overwhelming to see realistically. Panel composition and pacing draw attention to Aminata’s emotions and internal experiences, sometimes showing multiple feelings at once- grief, hope, fear, and resilience. In contrast, the photographs at the end ground the story in reality. The juxtaposition between the two forms- illustration and photography- creates a rhythm in the storytelling: the drawings invite empathy and understanding, and the photographs deliver the undeniable truth, emphasizing that this is lived experience, not fiction. The story also illuminated the broader social context of healthcare in Sierra Leone. The fear of hospitals during Ebola and COVID-19 closures shows how crises can compound maternal vulnerability and mistrust of medical institutions. Seeing Aminata navigate these challenges helped me better understand how systemic failures intersect with individual suffering. The narrative structure, combining text, illustrations, and photography, makes these social realities feel personal and human rather than abstract statistics. The combination of illustration and photography allowed me to engage with Aminata’s story in a way that was both emotionally accessible and truthful. The illustrations softened the rawness of her trauma enough for me to enter her world empathetically, while the photographs at the end served as a powerful reminder that these events are real. The story left me reflecting on the resilience of mothers, the silence often imposed on women in pain, and the importance of empathy in understanding experiences far removed from my own. Though I can never truly know what Aminata endured, the story allowed me to connect to her grief and courage on a human level, and to honor the realities of women who endure loss and fear in places where care is uncertain or inaccessible.</p>
