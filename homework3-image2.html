    <h1>Homework 3 Image 2</h1>

    <p>This photo is the low depth of field and it is a picture of Yael, she is in charge of the Hillel, where all these images are captured. She has great personality and I feel her naild capture that. You don't need to see anything else do understand who she is as a person.</p>
